## Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)
- Set of all behaviors of a system to be developed.

## Product Description

## Use Cases
- All possible user interactions with the system.

## Functional Requirements
- What the system should do.
- All desired operations of the system.
- ie. Calculator functions, 

## Nonfunctional Requirements
- How the system performs operations.
- System qualities, attributes, characteristics
- ie. Scalability, response time, usability, memory storage

## Test Plan
- Dynamic document that is constantly updated within testing deliverables.
- Plan for all testing activities to be done to deliver quality software
- Describes what to test and not what to test, how to test, and who will perform the test.
- Includes environment, tools needed, resource allocation, test technique and contingencies plan.
- Contingency plan: back up testing method if orignal is not feasible or efficient.
Test Plan Document IEEE 829 Standards:
1. Test Plan Identifier: Unique identifer for test plan.
2. References: Specifies all docs that support the test plan
  - SRS, Use Case Documents, Test Strategy, Project Plan, Project Guidelines, etc.
3. Introduction/Summary: 
  - Purpose and scope of the test.
4. Test Items
5. Features to be tested
  - List of all features to be tested in the project.
6. Features not to be tested.
7. Approach:
  - Overall strategy of how testing will be perofrmed, contains details such as Methodology, Test Types, etc.
8. Pass/Fail Criteria:
  -Specify criteria that will be used to determine pass or fail percentage of test items.
  -ie. Pass criteria for test cases should be > 95% and have no bugs.
9. Suspension Criteria:
  - Specify when to stop the testing.
  - ie. If major functionalities are not functional or system experiences login issues then testing should suspend. 
10. Test Deliverables:
  - List of all documents to be delivered at each phase of the of the testing life cycle
  - Test Cases, Test Report, etc.
11. Testing Tasks
  - List of testing tasks we need to complete for the current project.
  - ie. Test environment should be ready prior to test execution phase.  Test summary report needs to be prepared.
12. Environmental Needs
  - List of hardware, software and any other tools needed for the environment.
13. Responsibilities:
  - List of employee roles and responsilbities of each test task
  - ie. test plan should be prepared by Test Lead.  Preparation and execution of test should be carried out by Testers.
14. Staffing and Training Needs
15. Schedule: 
  - Complete details of on when to start, finish and how much time each tasks should take place.
16. Risks and Contingencies
  - Specify the probability of risks and contingencies to overcome those risks.
